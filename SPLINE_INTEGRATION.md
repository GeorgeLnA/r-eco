# Spline Animation Integration Guide for R-ECO

## 🚀 What is Spline?

Spline is a powerful 3D design tool that allows you to create interactive 3D experiences, animations, and prototypes without coding. It's perfect for showcasing renewable energy solutions in an engaging way.

## 📦 Installation

The required packages are already installed:
- `@splinetool/react-spline` - React component for Spline
- `@splinetool/runtime` - Spline runtime engine

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Create Your Spline Scene

1. Go to [spline.design](https://spline.design)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Design your 3D renewable energy scene (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.)
5. Add interactive elements (click, drag, hover effects)
6. Export your scene

### 2. Get Your Scene URL

After creating your scene:
1. Click "Export" in Spline
2. Choose "Web" export
3. Copy the generated URL (looks like: `https://prod.spline.design/your-project/scene.splinecode`)

### 3. Replace the Demo Scene

In `client/pages/Index.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
<DemoSplineScene />
```

With:
```tsx
<SplineAnimation 
  sceneUrl="YOUR_ACTUAL_SPLINE_SCENE_URL"
  className="w-full h-full"
/>
```

## 🎨 Component Structure

### SplineAnimation Component
- **Location**: `client/components/SplineAnimation.tsx`
- **Props**: 
  - `sceneUrl`: Your Spline scene URL
  - `className`: Additional CSS classes
  - `style`: Custom styles

### DemoSplineScene Component
- **Location**: `client/components/DemoSplineScene.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Placeholder while you create your actual Spline scene

## 🌟 Ideas for Renewable Energy Animations

### Solar Panel Scene
- Interactive solar panel that rotates on hover
- Sun rays that animate based on time of day
- Energy flow visualization from panels to home

### Wind Turbine Scene
- Rotating wind turbine blades
- Wind speed effects
- Energy generation meter

### Home Energy System
- 3D house with solar panels
- Battery storage visualization
- Energy flow between components

### Heat Pump Scene
- Animated heat pump operation
- Temperature flow visualization
- Energy efficiency metrics

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Loading States
Customize the loading spinner in `SplineAnimation.tsx`:
```tsx
<div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-b-2 border-[#588157] mx-auto mb-4"></div>
```

### Styling
Modify the container styles:
```tsx
<div className="h-[400px] rounded-xl overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  {/* Your Spline component */}
</div>
```

### Responsive Design
The component automatically adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes.

## 📱 Performance Tips

1. **Optimize your Spline scene** - Reduce polygon count for better performance
2. **Use LOD (Level of Detail)** - Show simpler models on mobile devices
3. **Lazy load** - Only load Spline when the section is visible
4. **Compress textures** - Use optimized image formats

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Scene not loading**
   - Check your scene URL is correct
   - Ensure the scene is published in Spline
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Performance issues**
   - Reduce scene complexity
   - Check device capabilities
   - Use loading states

3. **Mobile compatibility**
   - Test on various devices
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Consider mobile-specific scenes

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create your Spline scene** with renewable energy themes
2. **Replace the demo scene** with your actual scene URL
3. **Add more animations** to other pages (About, Services, etc.)
4. **Create interactive product demos** for each service
5. **Add educational animations** explaining renewable energy concepts
